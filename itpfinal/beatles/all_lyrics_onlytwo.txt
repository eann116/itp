A club isn't the best place to find a lover,
So the bar is where I go.
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots,
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow.
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now.
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox,
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like,

Girl, you know I want your love.
Your love was handmade for somebody like me.
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
I may be crazy, don't mind me.
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much".
Grab on my waist and put that body on me.
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
Come, come on now, follow my lead.

I'm in love with the shape of you.
We push and pull like a magnet do.
Although my heart is fallin' too.
I'm in love with your body.
And last night, you were in my room.
And now my bed sheets smell like you.
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new.
Well, I'm in love with your body.

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I,
Well, I'm in love with your body.
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I,
Well, I'm in love with your body.
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I,
Well, I'm in love with your body.
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new.
I'm in love with the shape of you.

One week in, we let the story begin,
We're goin' out on our first date.
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat.
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate.
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay.
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat.
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like,

Girl, you know I want your love.
Your love was handmade for somebody like me.
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
I may be crazy, don't mind me.
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much".
Grab on my waist and put that body on me.
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you.
We push and pull like a magnet do.
Although my heart is fallin' too.
I'm in love with your body.
And last night, you were in my room.
And now my bed sheets smell like you.
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new.
Well, I'm in love with your body.

Lovin' can hurt.
Lovin' can hurt sometimes.
But it's the only thing that I know.
And when it gets hard.
You know it can get hard sometimes.
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.

We keep this love in a photograph.
We made these memories for ourselves.
Where our eyes are never closin'.
Hearts are never broken.
And time's forever frozen still.

So you can keep me.
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet.
You won't ever be alone.
Wait for me to come home.

Lovin' can heal.
Lovin' can mend your soul.
And it's the only thing that I know, know.
I swear it will get easier.
Remember that with every piece of ya.
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

Mm, we keep this love in this photograph.
We made these memories for ourselves.
Where our eyes are never closin'.
Hearts were never broken.
And time's forever frozen still.

So you can keep me.
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet.
You won't ever be alone.
And if you hurt me.
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed.
Inside these pages, you just hold me.
And I won't ever let you go.
Wait for me to come home.

Wait for me to come home.
Wait for me to come home.
Wait for me to come home.

Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen.
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be.
Keep it deep within your soul.
And if you hurt me,
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed.
Inside these pages, you just hold me.
And I won't ever let you go.

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me.
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street.
Hearin' you whisper through the phone.
"Wait for me to come home".

I found a love for me.
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead.
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet.
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me.

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love.
Not knowin' what it was.
I will not give you up this time.
But, darlin', just kiss me slow.
Your heart is all I own.
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine.

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms.
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song.
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath.
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight".

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know.
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home.
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets.
To carry love, to carry children of our own.

We are still kids, but we're so in love.
Fightin' against all odds.
I know we'll be alright this time.
Darlin', just hold my hand.
Be my girl, I'll be your man.
I see my future in your eyes.

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms.
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song.
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful.
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight.

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms.
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song.
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met.
An angel in person and she looks perfect.
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight.

When your legs don't work like they used to before.
And I can't sweep you off of your feet.
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?.
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?.
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy.
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three.


And I'm thinkin' 'bout how.
People fall in love in mysterious ways.
Maybe just the touch of a hand.
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day.
And I just wanna tell you I am.

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms.
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud.
Maybe we found love right where we are.

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades,
And the crowds don't remember my name.
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm.
I know you will still love me the same.
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen.
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory.

I'm thinkin' 'bout how,
People fall in love in mysterious ways.
And maybe it's all part of a plan.
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes.
Hoping that you'll understand.

That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms.
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud.
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh.

Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love

So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms.
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'.
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud.
That maybe we found love right where we are.
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are.
And we found love right where we are.

Thought I found a way.
Thought I found a way out (Found).
But you never go away (Never go away).
So I guess I gotta stay now.

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here.
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone.
Hello, welcome home.

Walking out of time.
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place).
Something's on my mind.
Always in my head space.

But I know someday I'll make it out of here.
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone.
Hello, welcome home.

Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home.

Things fall apart.
And time breaks your heart.
I wasn't there, but I know.
She was your girl.
You showed her the world.
But fell out of love and you both let go.

She was cryin’ on my shoulder.
All I could do was hold her.
Only made us closer until July.
Now, I know that you love me.
You don't need to remind me.
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind all the time.
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign.
Did I cross the line?

(Mm) Hmm

Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last).
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast).
I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better).
'Cause she couldn't be (Couldn't).
More different from me (Different).
Happy and free in leather (Happy).

And I know that you love me (You love me).
You don’t need to remind me (Remind me).
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby.

I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) all the time (All the time).
Feels like a fever (Like a fever), like I’m burning alive (Burning alive), like a sign.
Did I cross the line?

You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt.
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel.
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself.

And I wonder,
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?

You say no one knows you so well.
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt.
Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel.
I know you didn’t mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself.
