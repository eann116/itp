#JAVASCRIPT reading notes

#####Chapter 1 Values, Types, Operators
I didn't know that javascript could only use a fixed 64 bits, and that in order to create large sequences you have to use those 64 numbers and create patterns. I did know that strings of data are what creates text, and whatever you put within quotes.
#####Chapter 2 Program Structure
The terms expressions and statements are new to me. I learned about how expressions are more standalone produced values while statements have little value if by itself. I did know about the environment and the standard bindings that javascript is built in with.

#####Chapter 3 Functions
Unrelated to JavaScript, but I did know that english native speakers have 20,000 or more words in their vocabulary. I didn't know all of these different notations for functions, nor did I know the scope of bindings and such.
