# Python Reading

### 1 "The way of the Program"
- For one, I had no idea how to run, install, or use python on my computer in any way. A lot about how to start using python on my computer was helpful. 
- However, a lot of the terminology used in python are very similar to javascript, as well as math and grammar terms, so that was helpful.
### 3 "Functions"
- New information, assigning variables and defining them using expressions (especially with mathematical expressions), the variable you are trying to define should be on the left and the expression on the right.

- I knew that you could create new functions other than the ones already built into python. The article uses the example of 
`def print_lyrics() :,` (final project useful!)
### 5 "Conditionals and recursion"

- We've talked about Boolean Logic and Boolean expressions before, so this who idea of using the operator to calculate true/false statements I already knew about. Chained and nested conditionals also look very familiar because of javascript.

- Recursion was a new idea to me. I enjoyed reading about using conditionals to create this function to code a countdown system.
### 10 "Lists"
- Deleting elements in all honesty seems a little tedious. I imagined it would more easy to remove elements from strings and lists, but instead you have to use functions like `pop` or `del` or `remove`

- I understand the ability to assign values to list variables and use them to contain lists of different values, as this is simliar to the use and function of previous versions of lists we studied.
