# Band Project

#### eann116.github.io

First steps were relatively simple, we copied the template of the sample website for html from the past class, and just edited the titles and words to fit our band and own website. We found images, music online, as well as made our own gif to add to the website.

Problems faced were with CSS. We thought the CSS files weren't working but they were really just getting interfered with by our html file. The `<div></div>` around texts would cause any styling code not to work, so we changed all of those to `<p></p>` instead.

#### Self Assessment
I typed up the code for html, wrote most of the texts and quotes, but often needed help seeing how things would come together with CSS. I think overall I did pretty well, but if did it alone would need more time and help. 

#### Assessment of Peers
Mario was extremely helpful and knew exactly what he was doing. He kept trying to troubleshoot when CSS wasn't working, and we ultimately worked together to put html and css together and fix the problems in the code.
Roah was helpful with styling preferences, as well as writing our summary. I think when it came to the code she could have been more helpful or gave more input.
