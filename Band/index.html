	<h1>BAND</h1>

<h2>M.R.E the Band</h2>

<p>	  We are M.R.E. born from 90’s electronic chaos and raised in the 21st-century alt scene. Our music sounds like Daft Punk accidentally time-warping into a monastery rave. With our latest single “130 Mass 202”  on the way, we’re here to prove that enlightenment can have a beat drop! </p>
