### OVERVIEW
Often when I post content or reels that are remixes of songs, I have to type out and cut each part of the lyrics of the song. This takes a lot of time and effort. I want to code up a program that generates the lyrics for me. I know I could just google it and copy it in, but I also want to design this program to be able to change fonts, and even have animation/ sequences for the words when played.

#### A Good Outcome
Able to analyze a song and generate a set of lyrics from it, and also break it up by line and measure.
#### A Better Outcome
Able to generate lyrics and be able to break it up by line and measure. Also able to change font and transition animation.
#### The Best Outcome
All of the above, plus a way to save it as a video or clip to be able to paste into my videos.


#### CALENDER & STEPS
Nov-3rd - Nov- 9th : Research and Learning what the whole thing requires

Nov-10th - Nov-16th : Establish first draft of coding to create generator, obtain API?

Nov-17th - Nov-23rd : Finalize basic code and learn about animation software and font choosing.

Nov-24th - Nov-26th : Work on animation, finalize code for real if I end up procrastinating a week.

Nov-27th - Nov-30th : Eat turkey and enjoy home and thanksgiving.

Nov-30th - Due Date : Finalize things, fix code if needed.
